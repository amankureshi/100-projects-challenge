📖 Project 37: Storybook with Button Component using React.js  
Excited to share my **Storybook Button Component** project, part of my **100 Projects Challenge!** 🎉  

This project demonstrates how to create and document a **Button component** using **Storybook** in a React.js application. It helps in building reusable UI components with an interactive preview.  

🔍 How it Works:  
✅ **Button Variants:** Different button styles (primary, secondary, disabled, etc.) are created and showcased in Storybook.  
✅ **Interactive Controls:** Users can modify button text, size, and type dynamically.  
✅ **Component Isolation:** The button is developed and tested separately without running the full application.  
✅ **Event Handling:** Simulates button click events using Storybook actions.  

🛠️ Technologies Used:  
🚀 **React.js** – For creating the reusable Button component.  
📖 **Storybook** – For building, testing, and documenting the component.  
🎨 **CSS (Plain CSS or SCSS)** – For styling the button with a custom design.  
⚙️ **Controls & Actions Addon** – To test different states of the button interactively.  

✨ Use Case:  
🔹 Ideal for **design systems, UI libraries, and scalable React applications.**  
🔹 Helps in **component-driven development and faster UI testing.**  
🔹 Useful for **collaboration between developers and designers.**
