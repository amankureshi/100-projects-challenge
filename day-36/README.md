# ✨ Project: Demo User Authentication with Persistent Login using React.js, TypeScript & Tailwind CSS

🔗 **Live Demo**:[https://user-authentication-react.onrender.com/]

## 📄 Description

A fully functional demo authentication system built with React.js and TypeScript. It allows users to log in using mock credentials from a public API (JSONPlaceholder), and displays their profile (image, name, username, profession). The session is persisted using `localStorage`.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- ⚛️ React.js (with Hooks)
- 🧠 TypeScript
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- 🗂 LocalStorage (for session persistence)
- 🔗 JSONPlaceholder (mock user data)
- 📸 Pravatar (random profile images)

## 🌟 Features

- 🔐 Demo login using username & email as password
- 🧾 Realistic user profiles with image, name, and profession
- 🧠 Random professions assigned to each user
- ✅ Form validation with error messages
- 💾 Persistent login using `localStorage`
- 🔁 Logout functionality to clear session
- 📝 Helpful instructions shown to users on the login screen
- 🌗 Dark mode support (via Tailwind's dark classes)

## 🧪 How to Login

Use these demo credentials:

| Username    | Password (Email)     |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `Bret`      | `Sincere@april.biz`  |
| `Antonette` | `Shanna@melissa.tv`  |
| `Samantha`  | `Nathan@yesenia.net` |

## 🚀 Challenges Faced

- Validating form inputs in a user-friendly way
- Matching mock login logic with external API format
- Maintaining login session with localStorage
- Dynamically assigning and displaying user avatars and professions

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- How to build a mock login flow in React using external dummy APIs
- Managing authentication state across components
- Persisting login sessions without real backend using localStorage
- Creating a modern UI with Tailwind CSS
